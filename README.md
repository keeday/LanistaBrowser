Lanista Browser is a specialized tool for playing the web-based game [https://beta.lanista.se/](https://beta.lanista.se/)

**The Browser is in Beta, there will be bugs!**

## Main Features

**Theory Crafting**

Craft and build tactics, equip weapons and other equipment, and display final stats after race and equipment bonuses.

**Items Database** 

Provides a fully searchable database for all of Lanista's weapons, shields, equipment, and consumables with advanced filters. Mark specific items as favorites to find them easier later (e.g., in Theory Crafter).

**Timers and Reminders** (Upcoming)

Set reminders for upcoming tournaments, or set custom reminders.

**Data Sync** (Upcoming)

Once the Android version is released, I will look in to the possibilites of being able to sync your saved tactics between your clients.

## Installing

1. [Go here](https://github.com/keeday/LanistaBrowser/releases) and download the latest release.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder.  **Note -** Avoid folders requiring administrator rights. (Such as the Program Files folder).
3. Run "LanistaBrowser.exe" to launch the application.
4. **Note -** Antivirus software might block the browser.

## Requirements

On Windows the browser utilizes [Microsoft's Webview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).

* Webview will be pre-installed if you're on Windows 11.
* If you're on Windows 10 or earlier, you might need to install it.

## FAQ

**Will the browser be available for other systems?**

Yes, an Android version is planned. The framework (Avalonia) allows builds for Mac, iOS, and Linux. However, building, testing, and releasing for these platforms is currently not something I am capable of, as I do not use any of these systems. I am happy to try to build for these systems, but I will need assistance in testing before I publish.

**Do you have a roadmap?**

The closest thing to a roadmap is my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/platforms).

**I have an idea/found a bug!**

Great! The easiest way to contact me would be via Discord. You will find me lurking in Lanistas official Discord channel (@keeday)

**How do I use the Theory Crafter?**

I am currently working on a guide. Check back here later.
